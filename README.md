# shubhcron

Shubhcron is an auspicious cron runner. It is a drop-in replacement for your existing cron runners (cronie/anacron etc) and allows you to make sure that your jobs only run on auspicious timings.

The package comes with a `shubh` binary that you can use to wrap other programs and run them only if the current time is shubh.

For eg:

```bash
# Restart server, but if the time is auspicious
shubh shutdown --reboot
# Run package uprades, but only if the stars align
shubh apt-get upgrade --assume-yes
# Run deployments, but only if Saturn is in the fifth house
shubh kubectl set deployments image app application=$VERSION
# Schedule emails, but only if the Vedas indicate high conversions
shubh php artisan email:send
# Schedule money transfers to your preferred charity, but only if luck favours
shubh sendtoaddress <bitcoinaddress> <amount>
# Run the JVM garbage collector, but only if all is well
shubh /usr/bin/bin/jcmd GC.run
# Sign documents, but only if the time is right
shubh gpg --sign
```

# Cron Usage

If you have the `shubh` binary available, you can prepend all your important jobs with `shubh` in your crontab to run them only if the time is right.

```
# Try this job every 15 minutes on the 31st of March after 6pm
*/15 18-23 31 MAR * /usr/bin/shubh rake finance:closing
```

If you are using the `shubhcron` package, you can omit the `/usr/bin/shubh`:

```
# Set the correct location of your server
LATITUDE=26.7880
LONGITUDE=82.1986
# Attempts to send a mail every 5 minutes, only runs if the time is shubh
*/5 * * * * sendmail --subject "shubh labh"
```

You can also pass an extra environment variable `SHUBH_WAIT=1` to sleep till the time is shubh instead of exiting.

# Installation

## Stand-Alone

If you'd like to not replace your system's `cron` package, you can download the `shubh` binary from the [releases page][releases] for your prefered OS and use it directly as a prefix in your cronjobs.

## Ubuntu

We have a ready Debian and Ubuntu package available that replaces the system `cron` package.

## Alpine Linux

An Alpine Linux package is also available

## Arch Linux

An AUR package is available at [AUR][aur] based on `cronie`.

## Kubernetes

We plan to release the kubernetes controller that lets you create shubhcron resources soon.
